# gem template

This is a GitHub template for creating Ruby gems. Press [**Use this template**](https://github.com/mattbrictson/gem/generate) to generate a project from this template. In the generated project, run this script to rename the gem to meet your needs:

```
$ ruby rename_template.rb
```

This template is based on `bundle gem` with some notable improvements:

- Circle CI configuration
- Minitest, with minitest-reporters for nicely formatted test output
- Rubocop with a good set of configuration
- [release-drafter](https://github.com/apps/release-drafter) GitHub Action for automating release notes
- A `rake bump` task to keep your Ruby and Bundler dependencies up to date
- A nice README with badges ready to go (see below)
